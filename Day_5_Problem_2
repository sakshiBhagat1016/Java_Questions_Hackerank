//Fourth line will contain weight of silver/gold in grams for which user want price.

//Constraints
//Price cannot be -ve and maximum can be 1000000.
//Weights entered by user can be between 0.01 gm to 1000 gms.

//Output Format
//One number representing value of gold/silver asked by user for a particular weight.
